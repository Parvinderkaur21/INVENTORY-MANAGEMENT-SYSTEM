# INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ASSIGNMENT
This repository is about the inventory management system.
It have all codes with json files and ipynb files .
The system is working on NoSQL based database.
In this , new inventory can be added.
Purchase can be done.
I have used JSON system in it. 
There is one json file for the record that my inventory have and one for the number of transictions that have made by the store.

I have added 6 attributes per product :
1. Name of the product
2. Price
3. Quantity
4. Expiry date
5. Supplier name
6. Measurement

My project can do the following:
1. Add new items to the inventory
2. Purchase for customers
3. Generate Bills
4. Read data from inventory
